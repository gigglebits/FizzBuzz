FizzBuzz

Purpose: Part of Mizzou's IT4320 Software Engineering Class as a way to explore git. The objective of this assignment is to do the infamous fizzBuzz problem, but to do it in three separate branches with three separate goals. In this assignment I have the three branches, but have merged them all with the main. My branches are:

1. Main - The final program
2. gitItWorkin - bare bones satisfying the objective.
3. gitItWorkinBetter - making some kind of efficiency improvement. 
4. gitItPretty - make the code readable with some comments and add some features to make it a little more usable like making it an object method. 

This is my submittion for the assignment.
